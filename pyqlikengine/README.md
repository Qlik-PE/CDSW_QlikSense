Qlik Engine API extended for Python
This is an attempt to implement a Qlik Engine API extension for Python. I started working on this May 7th 2017 and it is at a very experimental level. This is very much a hobby project that I will to work on it during my spare time, whenever I have enough inspiration to do so.

It uses Python 2.7, the Python json encoder: https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html and the websocket client:
